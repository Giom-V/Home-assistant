# Those automations are meant to alert me if something weird is going on, eg. an
# abnormal temperature.
#
# There are currently only 2 automations:
# * `Alert me if the temperature is too low`: In case the temperature in any of
#   the indoor rooms (including the basement) goes below 10 degrees, alert me
#   through Google Chat and my Google Homes.
# * `Alert me if the temperature is too high`: Same if the temperature goes over
#   30 (to be tweaked since I think it happens quite frequently in summer)
#
# I also used to have automations related to noise and moisture but they were
# using my [Minut Point](minut.com) devices but since I can't inteface them with
# HA I had to get rid of the automations. I also used to have 2 automations
# related to my freezer, using a door sensor because my daughter used to forget
# to close it, but I now have a new freezer which beeps so I also disabled the
# automations. I'm still keeping them all here as reference.
