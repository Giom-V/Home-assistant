# Those automations are related to my air purifier located in my office. That's
# the reason why their are all using the `input_boolean.working` value that
# indicates if I'm working in my office or not. That value is managed in
# [`working.yaml`](#working), documented below.
#
# There are 3 automations:
# * `Turn on Air Purifier when I start working`: As its name implies starts the
#   air purifier when I start working.
# * `Turn off Air Purifier when I'm off`: Turns it off when I stop working
# * `Turn off Air purifier for a while if the air quality is good`: In case the
#   air quality is good enough (PM5 under 2 for 5mn), I then turn off the air
#   purifier until it becomes bad (PM5 over 5) for at least 15mn. This is meant
#   to save energy and extend filters life.
