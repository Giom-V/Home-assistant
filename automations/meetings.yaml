# Theses automations are meant to switch a light colors depending on if I'm in a
# meeting and if I'm talking (using the [Mutesync](mutesync.com) device and
# integration), but since I have set it up since my last move I'm not going to
# comment on it. It's quite straightforward so it shouldn't be hard to
# understand.
