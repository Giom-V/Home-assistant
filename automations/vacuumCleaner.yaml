# Here are all the automations related to my vacuum cleaner.
#
# Note that some of the logic is managed in [scripts](../scripts/), in the
# [`vacuum.yaml`](../scripts/vacuum.yaml) file.
#
# Some automations were related to the IFTT integration but since [Google
# removed the option for IFTTT to parce custom
# commands](https://ifttt.com/explore/google-assistant-changes), I had to get
# rid of them. Initially they were letting me say "OK Google, Clean the bedroom
# 3 times", and the string "the betroom 3 times" was passed down to HA, parsed
# (cf. [scripts](../scripts/vacuum.yaml)) and then the right command was sent to
# the vaccum.
#
# The remaining automations are:
# * `Start Cleaning Room`: I have a selector name `input_select.vacuum_room`
#   which contains all the rooms in the house, selecting a room triggers the
#   cleaning of it. I'm not really using it often but keeping it just in case.
# * `vacuum Kitchen and dining room when we are away`: This one is a very basic
#   automation that starts the vaccum at a fixed time if we are not home. It's
#   not used anymore but kept as a reference. It was good enough when we were
#   both working at the office but not anymore.
# * `vacuum Kitchen and dining room when we are away (Covid version)`: It's the
#   advanced version, named "Covid" because I started to work home during the
#   pandemic. It waits for us to be away for 5mn (the timer is short because I
#   was it to start while I'm bringin my daughter to school in the morning).
#   Then if we do not have visitors, or if its' not too late or too early, if
#   it's a worked day (in which case only 1 of us needs to be away) or not (in
#   which case we need to be both away), and finally if it had not done any
#   cleaning in the last 12h, it starts vaccuming the kitchen, the dining room
#   and the bathroom. This is my most complicated automation, at least in regard
#   to conditions.
# * `Update the time of the last cleaning`: I'm tracking in
#   `input_datetime.last_vacuum` the last time the vaccum cleaner has been doing
#   its job, so taht I'm not triggering it more than every 12h. That automation
#   save the time whenever the vaccum is used.
# * `Start/stop xiaomi fast scan interval` and `Update xiaomi map extractor`:
#   The [Xiaomi
#   integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/xiaomi_miio/#xiaomi-mi-robot-vacuum)
#   stops working if it receives too many calls per day and the [map
#   extractor](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/Home-Assistant-custom-components-Xiaomi-Cloud-Map-Extractor)
#   one is making a lot of calls if we want to be able to follow the vacuum on
#   the map in real time. So that two automations work together to only update
#   the map when one of the vacuum is in use.
