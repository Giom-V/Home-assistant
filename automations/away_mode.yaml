# Those automations are also related to something unexpected happening at home, but the caveat with the [alerts](#alerts) is that those ones should not trigger if somebody is at home. They are mostly related to multiple ways of detecting presence, from the using cameras or motion sensors to lights being switched on.
#
# There are also some tentative for presence simulation.
#
# All those automations are using the 3 helpers
# * `binary_sensor.people_home` indicates if someone who's tracked (my wife and I) are home. The issue is that it doesn't take into account that my daughter could be [home alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone), which for now doesn not happen often since she's still young or that we may have visitors (my parents or my in-laws for ex.), which is a case that happen quite often.
# * `input_boolean.visitors` is meant to solve that problem. It indicates that we have someone visiting and prevents the different automations from triggering.
# * `input_boolean.away_mode` indicates that the "alarm/alerts" are set. Using such a helper lets us clearly see the status and also let us overwrite it if needed.
#
# All those helpers are exposed to Google home so that we can easily switch*overwrite them.
#
# The different automations are:
# * `Switch Away mode on when we are away for more than an hour`: This is the automation that switches the `input_boolean.away_mode` value to on when we are away, this then enables all the other automations. There's a slight delay to prevent the alarm to switch too often, to cover for when we leave our daughter for a short while, or if the geofencing becomes flaky and our home/away presence switches.
# * `Switch Away mode off when we come back`: This is the reverse automation, setting off `input_boolean.away_mode` and the alerts. It also sets the media players volumes back to normal since the alerts are raising them to the maximum.
# * `Switch motion detection and alarms on when the away mode is on` and `Switch motion detection off when the away mode is off`: These used to switch the motion detection of my Dafang camera on and off when we were home/away, but that's not possible with my new Reolink cameras so I disabled the automations.
# * `Motion detected`: Sends an alert (via Google Chat), and shout through all the media players if motion is detected by one of the cameras. Mode is `single` because I don't want the script to restart if motion is continuously detected.
# * `Door openned while away`: Does the same thing but if a door is opened. 
# * `Mouvement detected while away`: Same again but if one of the motion sensors sees something.
# * `Lights switched on while away`: Same with lights being switched on, the problem being that we also want to switch on the lights for presence detection, so for now the lights used for the presence are not in this automation.
# * `Presence simulation Bureau`: Presence detection in my office. It uses randomness for more realness. Starts at a random time between 30 before sunset and 15mn after and ends between 11PM and 11:15PM.
# * `Presence simulation Aurore's bedroom`: Same thing but with slightly different times (the worst that could happen would be to have all lights switching on and off at the same time).
# * `Reboot HA every week when we are away`: This one is a failsafe. When I'm away for a long time I want to be certain HA is not frozen, so I like to reboot it at least once a week. I also have a Shelly plug that I program to reboot the modem every week for the same reason.
