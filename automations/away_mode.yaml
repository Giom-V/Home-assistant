# Those automations are also related to something unexpected happening at home,
# but the caveat with the [alerts](#alerts) is that those ones should not
# trigger if somebody is at home. They are mostly related to multiple ways of
# detecting presence, from the using cameras or motion sensors to lights being
# switched on.
#
# There are also some tentative for presence simulation.
#
# All those automations are using the 3 helpers
# * `binary_sensor.people_home` indicates if someone who's tracked (my wife and
#   I) are home. The issue is that it doesn't take into account that my daughter
#   could be [home alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone), which for
#   now doesn not happen often since she's still young or that we may have
#   visitors (my parents or my in-laws for ex.), which is a case that happen
#   quite often.
# * `input_boolean.visitors` is meant to solve that problem. It indicates that
#   we have someone visiting and prevents the different automations from
#   triggering.
# * `input_boolean.away_mode` indicates that the "alarm/alerts" are set. Using
#   such a helper lets us clearly see the status and also let us overwrite it if
#   needed.
#
# All those helpers are exposed to Google home so that we can easily
# switch*overwrite them.
#
# The different automations are:
# * `Switch Away mode on when we are away for more than an hour`: This is the
#   automation that switches the `input_boolean.away_mode` value to on when we
#   are away, this then enables all the other automations. There's a slight
#   delay to prevent the alarm to switch too often, to cover for when we leave
#   our daughter for a short while, or if the geofencing becomes flaky and our
#   home/away presence switches.
# * `Switch Away mode off when we come back`: This is the reverse automation,
#   setting off `input_boolean.away_mode` and the alerts. It also sets the media
#   players volumes back to normal since the alerts are raising them to the
#   maximum.
# * `Switch motion detection and alarms on when the away mode is on` and `Switch
#   motion detection off when the away mode is off`: These used to switch the
#   motion detection of my Dafang camera on and off when we were home/away, but
#   that's not possible with my new Reolink cameras so I disabled the
#   automations.
# * `Motion detected`: Sends an alert (via Google Chat), and shout through all
#   the media players if motion is detected by one of the cameras. Mode is
#   `single` because I don't want the script to restart if motion is
#   continuously detected.
# * `Door openned while away`: Does the same thing but if a door is opened.
# * `Mouvement detected while away`: Same again but if one of the motion sensors
#   sees something.
# * `Lights switched on while away`: Same with lights being switched on, the
#   problem being that we also want to switch on the lights for presence
#   detection, so for now the lights used for the presence are not in this
#   automation.
# * `Presence simulation Bureau`: Presence detection in my office. It uses
#   randomness for more realness. Starts at a random time between 30 before
#   sunset and 15mn after and ends between 11PM and 11:15PM.
# * `Presence simulation Aurore's bedroom`: Same thing but with slightly
#   different times (the worst that could happen would be to have all lights
#   switching on and off at the same time).
# * `Reboot HA every week when we are away`: This one is a failsafe. When I'm
#   away for a long time I want to be certain HA is not frozen, so I like to
#   reboot it at least once a week. I also have a Shelly plug that I program to
#   reboot the modem every week for the same reason.
