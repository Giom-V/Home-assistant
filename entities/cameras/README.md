# Cameras integrations

**Documentation:** <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/camera/>

Here are the cameras I was using (but not currently), with each their
specificities.

## (Dafang)[dafang.yaml]

An old Xiaomi camera that I was using with an open-source [custom
firmware](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks).

## (Raspberry Camera)[rpi_camera.yaml]

I used this integration to control a camera plugged into my Raspberry pi and
take pictures every hour and fo a timelapse. Now that the Raspberry pi in the
basement it makes less sense to use it so I plan to use antooher camera to make
timelapses.

## (Environment Canada)[environment_canada.yaml]

This was a way to get an radar imagery from the [environement
Canada](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/environment_canada/#camera)
integration.

Not using it since I'm not living in Canada anymore.
