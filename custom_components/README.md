# Custom Components

This folder contains custom integrations that are not part of the core Home Assistant distribution. These components are either developed by third-party developers or are custom-made to extend the functionality of Home Assistant.

Most of the integrations in this folder are installed and managed through the [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](<https://hacs.xyz/>).
